# Switching Styles
The theme offers 3 different styles: `Default`, `Midnight Dusk`, and `Tako`. Reason for this is because most of the other themes were default style coloring but with different accent colors. I did not include legacy blue due to it being too annoying to get done properly.
- If you're a Powercord / Vizality user and would like to switch styles, head over to `./src/_style.scss`, disable the current style, and enable the desired style.
- If you're a BetterDiscord user and would like to switch styles, open the theme file, disable the current style, and enable the desired style.
