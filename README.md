# NO LONGER MAINTAINED
I was supposed to rework this but never got around to it and I most likely never will. Anyone is free to maintain this (as long as they follow the licensing of course).

# Tachi-Cord
Styles that are inspired from Tachiyomi's color scheme, made for Discord.

# Switching Styles
The theme offers 3 different styles: `Default`, `Midnight Dusk`, and `Tako`. Reason for this is because most of the other themes were default style coloring but with different accent colors. I did not include legacy blue due to it being too annoying to get done properly.
- If you're a Powercord / Vizality user and would like to switch styles, head over to `./src/_style.scss`, disable the current style, and enable the desired style.
- If you're a BetterDiscord user and would like to switch styles, open the theme file, disable the current style, and enable the desired style.
